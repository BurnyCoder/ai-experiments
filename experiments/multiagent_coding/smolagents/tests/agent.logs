On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n\n\n- read_file: Reads and returns the contents of a file.\n    Takes inputs: {\'filepath\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'description\': \'Path to the file to read\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- read_directory: Lists contents of a directory.\n    Takes inputs: {\'dirpath\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'nullable\': True, \'description\': \'Path to the directory to read.

Always provide a \'Thought:\' sequence, and a \'Code:\n```py\' sequence ending with \'```<end_code>\' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \'answer = wiki({\'query\': "What is the place where James Bond lives?"})\', but use the arguments directly as in \'answer = wiki(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")\'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\'t name a variable \'final_answer\'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\'collections\', \'math\', \'signal\', \'smolagents\', \'concurrent\', \'argparse\', \'functools\', \'zipfile\', \'codecs\', \'dataclasses\', \'hashlib\', \'typing\', \'fractions\', \'xdrlib\', \'queue\', \'time\', \'zoneinfo\', \'hmac\', \'glob\', \'zlib\', \'shutil\', \'pathlib\', \'abc\', \'streamlit\', \'enum\', \'yaml\', \'fnmatch\', \'heapq\', \'types\', \'http\', \'encodings\', \'gettext\', \'operator\', \'uuid\', \'gzip\', \'subprocess\', \'pickle\', \'statistics\', \'difflib\', \'weakref\', \'email\', \'random\', \'tempfile\', \'re\', \'portkey\', \'logging\', \'dbm\', \'unicodedata\', \'socket\', \'sqlite3\', \'copy\', \'threading\', \'rlcompleter\', \'struct\', \'secrets\', \'locale\', \'marshal\', \'sys\', \'bisect\', \'mmap\', \'stat\', \'multiprocessing\', \'asyncio\', \'itertools\', \'contextvars\', \'bz2\', \'datetime\', \'numbers\', \'calendar\', \'csv\', \'string\', \'netrc\', \'lzma\', \'array\', \'os\', \'io\', \'base64\', \'decimal\', \'shelve\', \'tarfile\', \'pprint\', \'linecache\', \'urllib\', \'configparser\', \'plistlib\', \'json\', \'requests\', \'readline\', \'textwrap\']\n9.

If empty, returns contents of entire project directory.\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- write_file: Writes content to a file.\n    Takes inputs: {\'filepath\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'description\': \'Path where to write the file\'}, \'content\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'description\': \'Content to write to the file\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {\'answer\': {\'type\': \'any\', \'description\': \'The final answer to the problem\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\n\nYou can also give requests to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is \'request\', a long string explaining your request.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your request.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- code_review_agent: This is an agent that can review code and provide feedback.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a \'Thought:\' sequence, and a \'Code:\n```py\' sequence ending with \'```<end_code>\' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \'answer = wiki({\'query\': "What is the place where James Bond lives?"})\', but use the arguments directly as in \'answer = wiki(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")\'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\'t name a variable \'final_answer\'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\'collections\', \'math\', \'signal\', \'smolagents\', \'concurrent\', \'argparse\', \'functools\', \'zipfile\', \'codecs\', \'dataclasses\', \'hashlib\', \'typing\', \'fractions\', \'xdrlib\', \'queue\', \'time\', \'zoneinfo\', \'hmac\', \'glob\', \'zlib\', \'shutil\', \'pathlib\', \'abc\', \'streamlit\', \'enum\', \'yaml\', \'fnmatch\', \'heapq\', \'types\', \'http\', \'encodings\', \'gettext\', \'operator\', \'uuid\', \'gzip\', \'subprocess\', \'pickle\', \'statistics\', \'difflib\', \'weakref\', \'email\', \'random\', \'tempfile\', \'re\', \'portkey\', \'logging\', \'dbm\', \'unicodedata\', \'socket\', \'sqlite3\', \'copy\', \'threading\', \'rlcompleter\', \'struct\', \'secrets\', \'locale\', \'marshal\', \'sys\', \'bisect\', \'mmap\', \'stat\', \'multiprocessing\', \'asyncio\', \'itertools\', \'contextvars\', \'bz2\', \'datetime\', \'numbers\', \'calendar\', \'csv\', \'string\', \'netrc\', \'lzma\', \'array\', \'os\', \'io\', \'base64\', \'decimal\', \'shelve\', \'tarfile\', \'pprint\', \'linecache\', \'urllib\', \'configparser\', \'plistlib\', \'json\', \'requests\', \'readline\', \'textwrap\']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don\'t give up! You\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nYou are an expert Python programmer. Your task is to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code based on the given requirements.\nFollow these guidelines:\n- Write code that follows PEP 8 style guidelines\n- Include clear docstrings and comments\n- Use descriptive variable names\n- Write modular and reusable code\n- Handle edge cases and errors appropriately\n- Focus on readability and maintainability\n\nYou have access to the current project\'s files in development through the following tools:\n- read_file: Read contents of a file\n- read_directory: List contents of a directory\n- write_file: Write content to a file\n\nWhen you generate code, send it to the code review critic agent! After its reviewed, send the final code back to the user.\n\nWhen you receive a coding task, don\'t return the final code directly. Instead:\n\n1. Write the initial code implementation\n2. Call the code review agent to review it using the code_review_agent tool\n3. Incorporate the feedback and improvements\n4. Return the final improved code\n\nYou have access to the current project\'s files in development through the following tools:\n- read_file: Read contents of a file\n- read_directory: List contents of a directory\n- write_file: Write content to a file\n\nRemember to:\n- Always use function calling rather than direct responses\n- Let the code review agent validate and improve the code\n- Only return the final code after review and improvements\n- Always save the code to a file using the write_file tool'}]}, {'role': <MessageRole.USER: 'user'>, 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'New task:\nWrite a Python function to calculate factorial recursively.'}]}, {'role': <MessageRole.ASSISTANT: 'assistant'>, 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'I\'ll help write a clean and efficient recursive factorial function.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n\n\n- read_file: Reads and returns the contents of a file.\n    Takes inputs: {\'filepath\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'description\': \'Path to the file to read\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- read_directory: Lists contents of a directory.\n    Takes inputs: {\'dirpath\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'nullable\': True, \'description\': \'Path to the directory to read. If empty, returns contents of entire project directory.\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- write_file: Writes content to a file.\n    Takes inputs: {\'filepath\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'description\': \'Path where to write the file\'}, \'content\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'description\': \'Content to write to the file\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {\'answer\': {\'type\': \'any\', \'description\': \'The final answer to the problem\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\n\nYou can also give requests to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is \'request\', a long string explaining your request.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your request.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- code_review_agent: This is an agent that can review code and provide feedback.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a \'Thought:\' sequence, and a \'Code:\n```py\' sequence ending with \'```<end_code>\' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \'answer = wiki({\'query\': "What is the place where James Bond lives?"})\', but use the arguments directly as in \'answer = wiki(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")\'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\'t name a variable \'final_answer\'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\'collections\', \'math\', \'signal\', \'smolagents\', \'concurrent\', \'argparse\', \'functools\', \'zipfile\', \'codecs\', \'dataclasses\', \'hashlib\', \'typing\', \'fractions\', \'xdrlib\', \'queue\', \'time\', \'zoneinfo\', \'hmac\', \'glob\', \'zlib\', \'shutil\', \'pathlib\', \'abc\', \'streamlit\', \'enum\', \'yaml\', \'fnmatch\', \'heapq\', \'types\', \'http\', \'encodings\', \'gettext\', \'operator\', \'uuid\', \'gzip\', \'subprocess\', \'pickle\', \'statistics\', \'difflib\', \'weakref\', \'email\', \'random\', \'tempfile\', \'re\', \'portkey\', \'logging\', \'dbm\', \'unicodedata\', \'socket\', \'sqlite3\', \'copy\', \'threading\', \'rlcompleter\', \'struct\', \'secrets\', \'locale\', \'marshal\', \'sys\', \'bisect\', \'mmap\', \'stat\', \'multiprocessing\', \'asyncio\', \'itertools\', \'contextvars\', \'bz2\', \'datetime\', \'numbers\', \'calendar\', \'csv\', \'string\', \'netrc\', \'lzma\', \'array\', \'os\', \'io\', \'base64\', \'decimal\', \'shelve\', \'tarfile\', \'pprint\', \'linecache\', \'urllib\', \'configparser\', \'plistlib\', \'json\', \'requests\', \'readline\', \'textwrap\']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don\'t give up!

After its reviewed, send the final code back to the user.\n\nWhen you receive a coding task, don\'t return the final code directly. Instead:\n\n1. Write the initial code implementation\n2.

Additional Features:\n   - Could add an optional parameter for choosing between recursive/iterative\n   - Possibility to add precision control for large numbers\n\n4. Documentation Enhancements:\n   - Add performance comparison with math.factorial()\n   - Include more examples with edge cases\n\nExample Implementation of Suggested Improvements:\n\n### 3. Additional context:\nThe current implementation is suitable for educational and general-purpose use. However, for production environments:\n1. Consider using math.factorial() for better performance\n2. For very large numbers, consider using decimal.Decimal or third-party libraries\n3. The recursive implementation might not be ideal for memory-constrained environments\n4. Unit tests would be beneficial to verify edge cases and performance\n"}]}], tool_calls=[ToolCall(name='python_interpreter', arguments='# Create final implementation incorporating all feedback\ncode = """from functools import lru_cache\nimport sys\nfrom typing import Optional\n\ndef factorial(n: int, method: str = \'recursive\') -> int:\n    \\"\\"\\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.\n    \n    The factorial of n (written as n!) is the product of all positive integers\n    less than or equal to n.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\'t name a variable \'final_answer\'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\'collections\', \'math\', \'signal\', \'smolagents\', \'concurrent\', \'argparse\', \'functools\', \'zipfile\', \'codecs\', \'dataclasses\', \'hashlib\', \'typing\', \'fractions\', \'xdrlib\', \'queue\', \'time\', \'zoneinfo\', \'hmac\', \'glob\', \'zlib\', \'shutil\', \'pathlib\', \'abc\', \'streamlit\', \'enum\', \'yaml\', \'fnmatch\', \'heapq\', \'types\', \'http\', \'encodings\', \'gettext\', \'operator\', \'uuid\', \'gzip\', \'subprocess\', \'pickle\', \'statistics\', \'difflib\', \'weakref\', \'email\', \'random\', \'tempfile\', \'re\', \'portkey\', \'logging\', \'dbm\', \'unicodedata\', \'socket\', \'sqlite3\', \'copy\', \'threading\', \'rlcompleter\', \'struct\', \'secrets\', \'locale\', \'marshal\', \'sys\', \'bisect\', \'mmap\', \'stat\', \'multiprocessing\', \'asyncio\', \'itertools\', \'contextvars\', \'bz2\', \'datetime\', \'numbers\', \'calendar\', \'csv\', \'string\', \'netrc\', \'lzma\', \'array\', \'os\', \'io\', \'base64\', \'decimal\', \'shelve\', \'tarfile\', \'pprint\', \'linecache\', \'urllib\', \'configparser\', \'plistlib\', \'json\', \'requests\', \'readline\', \'textwrap\']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don\'t give up!

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n\n\n- read_file: Reads and returns the contents of a file.\n    Takes inputs: {\'filepath\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'description\': \'Path to the file to read\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- read_directory: Lists contents of a directory.\n    Takes inputs: {\'dirpath\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'nullable\': True, \'description\': \'Path to the directory to read. If empty, returns contents of entire project directory.\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- write_file: Writes content to a file.\n    Takes inputs: {\'filepath\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'description\': \'Path where to write the file\'}, \'content\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'description\': \'Content to write to the file\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {\'answer\': {\'type\': \'any\', \'description\': \'The final answer to the problem\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\n\nYou can also give requests to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is \'request\', a long string explaining your request.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your request.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- code_review_agent: This is an agent that can review code and provide feedback.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a \'Thought:\' sequence, and a \'Code:\n```py\' sequence ending with \'```<end_code>\' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \'answer = wiki({\'query\': "What is the place where James Bond lives?"})\', but use the arguments directly as in \'answer = wiki(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")\'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\'t name a variable \'final_answer\'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\'collections\', \'math\', \'signal\', \'smolagents\', \'concurrent\', \'argparse\', \'functools\', \'zipfile\', \'codecs\', \'dataclasses\', \'hashlib\', \'typing\', \'fractions\', \'xdrlib\', \'queue\', \'time\', \'zoneinfo\', \'hmac\', \'glob\', \'zlib\', \'shutil\', \'pathlib\', \'abc\', \'streamlit\', \'enum\', \'yaml\', \'fnmatch\', \'heapq\', \'types\', \'http\', \'encodings\', \'gettext\', \'operator\', \'uuid\', \'gzip\', \'subprocess\', \'pickle\', \'statistics\', \'difflib\', \'weakref\', \'email\', \'random\', \'tempfile\', \'re\', \'portkey\', \'logging\', \'dbm\', \'unicodedata\', \'socket\', \'sqlite3\', \'copy\', \'threading\', \'rlcompleter\', \'struct\', \'secrets\', \'locale\', \'marshal\', \'sys\', \'bisect\', \'mmap\', \'stat\', \'multiprocessing\', \'asyncio\', \'itertools\', \'contextvars\', \'bz2\', \'datetime\', \'numbers\', \'calendar\', \'csv\', \'string\', \'netrc\', \'lzma\', \'array\', \'os\', \'io\', \'base64\', \'decimal\', \'shelve\', \'tarfile\', \'pprint\', \'linecache\', \'urllib\', \'configparser\', \'plistlib\', \'json\', \'requests\', \'readline\', \'textwrap\']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don\'t give up! You\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nYou are an expert Python programmer.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n\n\n- read_file: Reads and returns the contents of a file.\n    Takes inputs: {\'filepath\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'description\': \'Path to the file to read\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- read_directory: Lists contents of a directory.\n    Takes inputs: {\'dirpath\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'nullable\': True, \'description\': \'Path to the directory to read. If empty, returns contents of entire project directory.\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- write_file: Writes content to a file.\n    Takes inputs: {\'filepath\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'description\': \'Path where to write the file\'}, \'content\': {\'type\': \'string\', \'description\': \'Content to write to the file\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {\'answer\': {\'type\': \'any\', \'description\': \'The final answer to the problem\'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\n\nYou can also give requests to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is \'request\', a long string explaining your request.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your request.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- code_review_agent: This is an agent that can review code and provide feedback.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a \'Thought:\' sequence, and a \'Code:\n```py\' sequence ending with \'```<end_code>\' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \'answer = wiki({\'query\': "What is the place where James Bond lives?"})\', but use the arguments directly as in \'answer = wiki(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")\'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\'t name a variable \'final_answer\'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\'collections\', \'math\', \'signal\', \'smolagents\', \'concurrent\', \'argparse\', \'functools\', \'zipfile\', \'codecs\', \'dataclasses\', \'hashlib\', \'typing\', \'fractions\', \'xdrlib\', \'queue\', \'time\', \'zoneinfo\', \'hmac\', \'glob\', \'zlib\', \'shutil\', \'pathlib\', \'abc\', \'streamlit\', \'enum\', \'yaml\', \'fnmatch\', \'heapq\', \'types\', \'http\', \'encodings\', \'gettext\', \'operator\', \'uuid\', \'gzip\', \'subprocess\', \'pickle\', \'statistics\', \'difflib\', \'weakref\', \'email\', \'random\', \'tempfile\', \'re\', \'portkey\', \'logging\', \'dbm\', \'unicodedata\', \'socket\', \'sqlite3\', \'copy\', \'threading\', \'rlcompleter\', \'struct\', \'secrets\', \'locale\', \'marshal\', \'sys\', \'bisect\', \'mmap\', \'stat\', \'multiprocessing\', \'asyncio\', \'itertools\', \'contextvars\', \'bz2\', \'datetime\', \'numbers\', \'calendar\', \'csv\', \'string\', \'netrc\', \'lzma\', \'array\', \'os\', \'io\', \'base64\', \'decimal\', \'shelve\', \'tarfile\', \'pprint\', \'linecache\', \'urllib\', \'configparser\', \'plistlib\', \'json\', \'requests\', \'readline\', \'textwrap\']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don\'t give up! You\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nYou are an expert Python programmer. Your task is to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code based on the given requirements.\nFollow these guidelines:\n- Write code that follows PEP 8 style guidelines\n- Include clear docstrings and comments\n- Use descriptive variable names\n- Write modular and reusable code\n- Handle edge cases and errors appropriately\n- Focus on readability and maintainability\n\nYou have access to the current project\'s files in development through the following tools:\n- read_file: Read contents of a file\n- read_directory: List contents of a directory\n- write_file: Write content to a file\n\nWhen you generate code, send it to the code review critic agent! After its reviewed, send the final code back to the user.\n\nWhen you receive a coding task, don\'t return the final code directly. Instead:\n\n1. Write the initial code implementation\n2.
